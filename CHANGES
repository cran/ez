1.6:
- removed automatic addition of linespace to x & y axis labels.
- fixed version number/date in documentation.
- added feature to optionally collapse a within variable to a difference score (useful for plotting/describing mixed-between-and-within effects).
- added ezCor() for plotting correlation matricies.

1.5.1:
- fixed a bug whereby removing a Ss from the data prior to analysis would yield a "One or more cells missing data" error if the Ss variable was factored before removing the Ss.

1.5:
- fixed a bug whereby FLSD was computed improperly when requesting stats/plots including a less-than-complete set of between-Ss variables. The solution requires specification of the full set of between-Ss variables in addition to the less-than-complete set for which stats/plots are requested.

1.4.2:
- fixed a persisting bug in setting error bar width when the x-axis variable is converted from factor to numeric

1.4.1:
- fixed bug in "ezStats_main()" that caused "ezStats()" and "ezPlot()" to fail when groups are uneven

1.4:
- removed "ezLev()" function (base function "factor()" suffices)
- added "levels" argument to "ezPlot()" for easy reordering & renaming factor levels
- tweaked the legend from "ezPlot()" to avoid over-plotting bug from ggplot2
- fixed a bug in setting error bar width when the x-axis variable is converted from a factor to numeric
- added note in "ezANOVA()" documentation indicating that tests of Sphericity will only be provided for tests of effects with >2 levels
- added note in "ezStats()" & "ezPlot()" documentation describing the computation of FLSD
- added warning in "ezStats_main()" to flag unbalanced designs and notify user that FLSD is computed from the mean N per group.
- added check in "ezANOVA()" (and therefore "ezStats()" & "ezPlot()" for NA and missing cells after aggregation.

1.3:
- renamed "relev()" to "ezLev()" for package naming consistency
- ezlev() parameter "levs" renamed "new_order" for clarity
- cleaned up redundancy in ezANOVA_main code
- added a feature whereby prior to computation, ezANOVA will collapse (using a mean) any variables not specified in "within" or "between".

1.2:
- Added "partial eta squared" column in ANOVA output
- Where ezANOVA used to fail in the face of large total repeated measures df relative to N, it now uses an alternative approach in such cases that yields results (but no assumption tests).
- Simplified the output of ezStats & ezPlot
- Simplified the output of ezANOVA (removed levene tests for mixed within-and-between designs)
- added the "relev()" command for easy reordering the levels of factors
- implemented more reasonable default error bar hat widths when plotting categorical variables on the x-axis
